# Building the Meta-Dataset From the 4 BenchMark Datasets
The script here will build the metadataset

# Usage
There are no package dependencies. You will need to have all 4 of the benchmark datasets downloaded and uncompressed (RSD, UCMerced R45, PatternNet)

```
python3 build_dataset.py
```

Follow the prompts to tell the script where you have the benchmark dataset and where to place the finished dataset, and the script will do the rest.
